To set up and run this project on your local machine using XAMPP , follow these steps. First, start the XAMPP  control panel and make sure both Apache and MySQL services are running. Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. Create a new database by clicking on "New" in the sidebar, giving it a name such as recipe_book, and clicking "Create". After the database is created, click on its name and go to the "Import" tab. Choose the .sql file that came with the project (e.g., project.sql) and click "Go" to import the data and table structure into your new database.

Next, to run the project, copy the entire project folder (for example, recipe_book) into the web directory. For XAMPP, this is usually located at C:\xampp\htdocs\. Make sure there are no spaces in the folder nameâ€”rename it if necessary. Then, open the database connection file (such as login.php) and ensure the database credentials match your setup. Typically, these will be localhost as the server name, root as the username, a blank password, and recipe_book as the database name. Once everything is configured, open your browser and visit  http://localhost/recipie%20book/index.html to view and use the project.
